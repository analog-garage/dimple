Dimple version 0.07 release notes
==================================

Significant New Features Since v0.06
------------------------------------
- New option mechanism used for configuring solver options.

- New com.analog.lyric.options package supports type-safe hierarchical options.

- DimpleEnvironment provides some facilities that can be shared among multiple graphs, including a logging interface.

- Added built-in factors to convert between vectors of Real variables and RealJoint or Complex variables (ComplexToRealAndImaginary, RealAndImaginaryToComplex, RealJointProjection, RealJointToRealVector, RealVectorToRealJoint).

- Added built-in factor for complex absolute value (ComplexAbs), and associated use of overloaded abs() method in MATLAB API.

- Modified API for custom Java FactorFunctions, now requiring use of evalEnergy(Value[]) method instead of the other variants; and for deterministic directed FactorFunctions, evalDeterministic now takes a Value array argument instead of an Object array.

- Added methods for the Gibbs solver to determine the rejection rate when using Metropolis-Hastings and related samplers.

- Added methods for Real and RealJoint variables in the Gibbs solver to determine the sample mean and (co)variance.


Significant Bug Fixes Since v0.06
---------------------------------
- Fixed problem with gradle builds when git is not available or source tree is not a git clone.


Optimizations
--------------
- Domains and JointDomainIndexer objects in Java are now interned on creation to avoid creation of multiple equivalent instances.
